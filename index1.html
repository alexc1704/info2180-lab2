                    <p>There are many gaming devices being produced as of late. Ranging from consoles to Desktop computers and even as small as some handheld devices. Some notable gaming devices in the console region include; Xbox, Playstation and the Wii. Of these three, i was always attracted towards the playstation as i grew up with it. Now moving on to desktop gaming, this has the highest level of upgradability and design as users can style it any way they like. In terms of gaming standards, it has the highest level in terms of graphics and performance as users can also purchase parts to their liking. Lastly, we have the handheld devices like the Nintendo and Nintendo Switch. These devices are less performance driven and more focused on gaming on the go. </p>

                    <p>Sports are played all over the globe and it is an activity that brings multiple people together. For example, some sports inlcude Football, Basketball, Tennis, Swimming etc.. My favorite team in Football and Basketball are Real Madrid and The Milwuakee Bucks respectively. Growing up in Jamaica especially, i was always exposed to sports and will continue to play them recreationally. Some sports i am getting into inlcude pickleball and tennis. I had a tennis background growing up so these sports would come off as easier for me to partake in.</p>
